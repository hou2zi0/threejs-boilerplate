## Libraries

### Wrapper libraries fpor Three.js

* [enabled3d](https://enable3d.io/) "The project enable3d offers 4 different ways. As a Standalone 3D Framework, a Physics Plugin for three.js, as a 3D Objects and Physics extension for Phaser or as a library to run Ammo.js on Node.js."
    * [Enable3D - Javascript 3D engine with physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6nv3JIAFLk)
        * [Example Code](https://github.com/tamani-coding/enable3d-physics-examples)
* [aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/) "a-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js."

### Physics

* [ammo.js physics engine](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)
    * See links at enabled3d above as well. 

### Particle systems
